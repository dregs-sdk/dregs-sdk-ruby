## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-22

The first release. A server-side client for tracking events and reading scores.

### Added

- `Dregs::Client`, authenticating with a credential's `sk_` secret key against a configurable base
  URL, with no runtime dependencies beyond the standard library.
- `track` for recording backend events against an identity, always sending an idempotency `id` so a
  retry cannot double-count.
- `identities.get`, `identities.scores`, `identities.analysis`, and `identities.analyze`.
- Typed errors for 400, 401, 402, 403, 404, 429, and 5xx, plus connection and timeout failures, all
  deriving from `Dregs::Error`.
- Automatic retries with exponential backoff and jitter, honouring `Retry-After`.
- `Dregs::Webhooks.verify` for checking a webhook's signature and rejecting replays.
- Lenient models with a `raw` escape hatch, and RBS signatures in `sig/`.
